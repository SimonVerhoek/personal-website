							Hi. My name is Simon.
						</p>
						<p>
							I enjoy striving for perfection. Why? Because I think you deserve it.
						</p>
						<p>
							I am a fresh thinker with a passion for HCI, enhancing productivity and coming up with creative and elegant solutions for all of our everyday problems. As a multidisciplinary M.Sc. student with excellent communication skills, I speak the language of many professions. My background covers the fields of consumer behaviour, marketing and sales, business-IT alignment and the basic concepts of computer science and programming.

					<div class='myskills-text'>
						<p>
							My skillset revolves around being the connecting link between human and computer. I love communicating with people as well as with computers, and being a translator between them. Being able to both grasp the technical aspects and communicate these effectively to a non-technical audience, is what makes me a multidisciplinary game-changer.

							</ul>	
							<p> 
								People intrigue me. I love working with them in a team, helping them, observing their (sometimes quirky) behaviour.
							</p>
							<p>
								I dedicated four years of study and over two years of jobs and internships to getting a hold on how you think, why you buy what you buy and what makes you happy as a consumer. I learned about people's perception and decision theories, and practised persuasion and closing deals through promoting and selling a diversity of products and services.<br>
								Essentially, all consumers are looking for the same thing: products that acknowledge their needs, understand what they want to do and help them with achieving that goal in an efficient and elegant way.
							</p>
							<p>
								I enjoy finding people the right product to buy, but still too often I end up with having to choose the least worse one. There is still so much to improve.<br>
								Instead of selling people inferior products and feeling guilty, I decided to focus more on designing better products myself. By knowing what people want, how they want it and how to sell it to them, I am sure I can design one hell of a product or experience!

								<li>experienced in efficient administration handling</li>
								<li>experienced in interpreting large heaps of data</li>
							</ul>	
							<p>
								One of today's biggest problems for all of us, is having to deal with a flood of information beyond our control. Instead of doing the stuff we actually want to do, we are distracted by having to maintain and interpret stuff we shouldn't have to.
							</p>
							<p>
								I am a productivity geek. I crave organisation and simplicity. A M.Sc. study and working experience in UX and information processing have made me skilled in increasing productivity by decluttering and prioritising information streams. Enormous amounts of data do not overwhelm me: I filter, create oversight and present this in a manageable way in a matter without breaking a sweat. All without losing focus on even the smallest details.
							</p>
							<p>
								I believe that managing our (digital) lives is still far too difficult, and that I can do something about it.

								<li>Elementary knowledge of computer science concepts (algorithms, data structures, networking, HCI)</li>
							</ul>	
							<p>
								I have always loved working with computers. I have always been gaming, tweaking and fiddling with software. Colleagues, friends and family always know to find me for tech support, be it on Windows, OSX, mobile, routers or what else. But I wanted more.<br>
								<br>
								Since 2013, I have therefore been taking my skills to a whole new level by starting to learn programming and computer science concepts as algorithms, data structures and networking. I created this website, designed a mobile application (more about that in my portfolio) am currently busy with finishing up <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu" target="_blank">Harvard's CS50 course</a> and solving several <a href="http://wiki.phoib.net/wiki/index.php?title=Chips_%26_Circuits" target="_blank">algorithmic problems</a>.<br>
								<br>
								It is my dream to eventually take part in the design and development of new software ideas, blowing the world away with innovative products or services no one could ever have thought of.
